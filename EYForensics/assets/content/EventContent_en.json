I wanted to send you an email to explain the issues we had in implementing EYs ProBioTracker at Meva Pharma. Initially, Lucy Tan (CFO of Meva Pharma) was our main buyer and wanted the platform to increase efficiencies within the supply chain. Meva Pharma is struggling with their manufacturing productivity, one of the main reasons behind this is due to the fact there was no platform to seamlessly track documentations for the active pharmaceutical ingredients. However, the operations team at Meva Pharma were uneasy to make changes to their complex working methods. Eventually Lucy could not justify the disruption it would have caused the staff and therefore decided not to continue with initiative.</p><p>I believe the main reasons we lost the proposal was the lack of versatility in our team. If we had collaborated with the other service lines, we may have created a more holistic solution for Meva Pharma. The feedback I received about the proposal was that we were not fully catering to Meva Pharma&rsquo;s needs. In retrospect I may have been too cost focused in my approach and with a view to the future it will be &nbsp;important to achieve greater insights into Meva Pharma&rsquo;s day-to-day operations.

We would like to use the virtual certificates and ship them along with the substrates you mentioned in the meeting to indicate the source of our ingredients.

Many of their researchers lead consortiums in the development of drugs in which, the company frequently partners with academic institutions and projects are funded by national governments.

    "subtitle1_narrative1": "<p>Rio Blanco (RB) is a multinational Mining &amp; Metals (M&amp;M) corporation, founded in 1873. Since its beginnings, the company has grown through a long series of mergers and acquisitions to place itself among the world leaders in the production of many commodities such as iron ore, copper, diamonds, gold and uranium.</p><p>RB operates in a heavily regulated environment, as its HQ lies in the heart of Europia. The operations and digging sites are distributed all over the world, and recently the company has turned to Smirnovia to expand its extraction activities.</p><p>Rio Blanco has been widely criticized by environmentalist groups for its mining activities. Opposition to the company focuses on its mining methods due to the negative environmental implications. This includes the company's coal operations and their contribution towards global warming, and uranium operations and nuclear technology concerns. Due to these environmental restrictions, the company is looking to expand to Smirnovia, by acquiring the local M&amp;M company: Alumina.</p><p>Smirnovia is an emerging market characterized by a strong period of economic growth over the past years. The regulations in Smirnovia are more lenient when compared to Europia, and therefore it has become the target for many companies to expand their operations in the region. The following points have been highlighted for you to keep in mind when dealing stakeholders in the M&amp;M sector in Smirnovia:</p><ul><li>The global nature and scale of the M&amp;M sector, and the complexity of the working and contractual relationships with governments, venture partners, suppliers and other contractors, make compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulation something that requires significant management focus.</li><li>Companies in the M&amp;M sector operate in a high-pressure environment where the potential payoffs from successful ventures are considerable. Conversely, delays or downtime in the value chain have the potential to significantly erode the bottom line. This pressure can create an imbalance between compliance and operations and has the potential to induce activities that may be misaligned with corporate policies.</li><li>Local employees may have a strong network of relationships that have the potential to create conflicts of interest and increase the risk of bribery and corruption, such as those with public officials, vendors and community leaders. Differing cultures and business standards may lead to conflicts remaining undisclosed and business or funds being improperly channeled.</li></ul>",
