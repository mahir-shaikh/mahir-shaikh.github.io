Thus far, SEEN has not officially entered the public sector space, but it's clear this sector represents a large growth opportunity. There is an internal debate within HelloCloud about whether our technology could or should be used to enhance personal data collection, especially should SEEN decide to enter the government space upon becoming a customer of ours.<br><br>We've asked the AE to slow down a bit until we can surface the conversation with you. It's a sizeable deal and will close if we proceed.
