In this era of rapid change, CTRC is facing new challenges and opportunities; your ability to help them understand and navigate the Cognitive Enterprise journey will be key to positioning TJW as their partner in this growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will have to present a unique value proposition to CTRC, but pairing your team&apos;s talent and tools with a focus on consistency and quality will enable you to be successful. Talent is crucial and it must be invested in early and nurtured to ensure we have the right people, in the right places, with the right skills if a transformative opportunity opens up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will have the chance to refresh yourself on your account plan for CTRC separately, but in the meantime I want to reiterate how I will measure your success. Our primary success metrics are: &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;1) Revenue&lt;br&gt;2) Contract GP&lt;br&gt;3) Delivery NPS&lt;br&gt;4) Talent Engagement (made up of Expertise and Capacity)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a secondary basis, we will also be tracking &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;1) Collaboration Index&lt;br&gt;2) PTI&lt;br&gt;3) Signings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is up to you to determine the ideal strategy but I expect you to deliver 30% Contract GP Margin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Luck,&lt;br&gt;Charles R.
