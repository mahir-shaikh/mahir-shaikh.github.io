You know NRG is already using SAP applications, such as Concur, and that they are in the process of the S/4 HANA transformation. This is driven by fluctuations of oil prices and the need to strip costs out of supply chain, as well as the trend for more agile working environments. From Marten Quinten, EY&apos;s SAP Alliance Leader, you have understood that there are great opportunities to digitize processes and leverage SAP&apos;s cloud capabilities with S/4 HANA. This sounds like something that could help accelerate NRG&apos;s cost saving transformation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you initiate this conversation to bring out the most value for the client?" fmt="General">

<c f="The 3rd consecutive quarter of interest rates being held flat in all but one of the G7 economies has, on balance, signaled that economic growth is expected to be firm and inflation curtailed. But is austerity really over? Consumers and businesses alike were prepared for the lack of change in interest rates following a period of slow, small rises, but there are still question marks around what, the increased cost of borrowing will mean for the world&apos;s largest economies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emergia&apos;s prime minister has expressed worry about new research around population trends. Recent research published by the University of Emergia suggest that the majority of humanity will live in cities by 2050. Most of the growth will be coming from Asia and Africa, as their population is expected to grow by 1 million inhabitants each week. With predictions that roughly 32% of city dwellers will live in slums by 2050, many are questioning whether conventional urbanization can cope without significant civil unrest, health issues and infrastructural catastrophes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are robots taking of our jobs? That&apos;s the growing question following predictions published by The World Bank. Analyst research has shown that 77% of jobs in China and 67% of jobs in India are at risk from disruption caused by automation. When coupled with calculations estimating that 65% of the population of middle-income countries and 87% of low-income countries will be made up by citizens under the age of 25s, this raises really big questions for the future of education, skills and growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in finally in Celebrity News:  Producers of the popular TV show &quot;Top Ten&quot; have bought the rights to the European version of the show.

<c f="&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Jamie&apos;s networking ability is strong, and in future I would like to see Jamie harnessing opportunities to generate his internal and external networks at the same time by including other colleagues in client networking opportunities. Jamie has strong intuition and can pick up signals from prospective buyers. I would like to see more coaching of less experienced colleagues when it comes to asking better questions as I think this will help Jamie to refine his own questions more.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;As an experienced business development professional there is an increased need to be a proactive, big picture thinker rather than waiting to hear from Maturia&apos;s Business Development Leadership. Jamie&apos;s technical knowledge is sound and like all of us who operate in this really fast paced landscape, there is a lot of work to do to be able to represent all of EY. Jamie should keep up efforts to stay on top of the game in terms of having a baseline understanding of our latest technologies and approaches.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Jamie is incredibly personable one-on-one and really helped me to think about how to approach problems during the pursuit we had with a global retailer last quarter.
