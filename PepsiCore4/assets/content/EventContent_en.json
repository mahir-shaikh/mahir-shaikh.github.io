Although Jorge does have past management experience, he often feels unsure of how best to engage his team and to create a sense of confident leadership when many on the team seem to know more about the workings of Fizzy than he does. Earlier in the week, one of Jorge's more tenured employees, Aaron, created an off-schedule delivery that ended up causing a significant level of chaos for others across the building. What's more, it delayed an important order for one of the building's most important large-format customers, Senko Grocery. This is the second time Aaron has made a mistake like this. Jorge does not have an established relationship with Aaron, but he knows it's his responsibility to work with him. How should Jorge address the situation?",

Anna has coached her on the issue twice before, but Natalie's waste numbers remain higher than average.
