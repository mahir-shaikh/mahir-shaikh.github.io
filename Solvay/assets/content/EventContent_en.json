    "DirectMailBody0": "Dear {{tlInputTeamName_R1}},<br><br>I would like to inform you that we have received concerning information about one of your direct reports, Alex Waterford, from some of their team members. It appears that since the reorganization started last year, Alex has become rather impatient and irritable with people, whereas as you know they have always been more of the easy-going type and a great advocate for our values. I know Alex was disappointed by the change in direction to their business area and has repeatedly asked for more resources which, unfortunately, we will not be able to provide until we have greater clarity on the new global strategy for Solutions.<br><br>Alex has now cancelled a number of regular check-ins with colleagues in the Pandora Region and is often difficult to reach. I have heard from a recent exit interview with Romi Thomas, a member of Alex's team, that she left due to Alex's inconsistent management style. Romi complained about the team being left for themselves to deal with the changes brought on by the reorganization, and that when it came to project deliverables, clear direction was lacking and Alex had started taking over work from others when it &quot;inevitably&quot; didn't meet Alex's expectations.<br><br>I'd be happy to arrange a meeting if you want to discuss this further. I'm also including in this email Alex's team's latest performance data.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>Laura Mertens<br>Strategic Business Partner, Ernest & Alfred, Pandora Region<br><br>Attachment: Performance report for Alex Waterford, Aromatic Ingredients Director, Ernest & Alfred, Pandora Region",
    "DirectMailBody1": "Dear {{tlInputTeamName_R1}},<br><br>It is not in my regular habit to do this, but I think it is important for you to know some of the issues that my team has been having with your Aromatic Ingredients director, Alex Waterford lately. We've been collaborating with him and his team on three projects so far this year and every time there have been significant delays on his team's deliverables. This comes despite us agreeing on clear deadlines at the beginning of each project.<br><br>It is a challenging time for us since the reorganization and whilst we will have to wait and see what the future holds, in the mean time we need our senior leaders to step up and I am not seeing this from Alex. My team is working very hard to meet deadlines and are becoming frustrated by their output being tarnished by delays outside their control. This has impacts on our reputation both with clients and internally.<br><br>I trust that you will deal with this promptly and am hoping for a change in this situation soon as we are about to begin a new project in your region for a critical key account where there can be no room for failure.<br><br>Best,<br>Taylor<br><br>Taylor Allport<br>Global President of Aromatic Ingredients, Ernest & Alfred",

There have been some challenges along the way and tough decisions have been made across the globe. We are now placed well and are on the right route forward and we will look to communicate our new global strategy for Solutions in the coming year.<br><br>Best,<br>Sam Hulkenberg<br>Global COO Ernest & Alfred",
    "DirectMailBody3": "Dear {{tlInputTeamName_R1}},<br><br>Ahead of our 1:1 meeting this week I am hoping that you may be able to provide some updates on the Global strategy for Solutions. As you know, since the reorganization, now we are having to do more with less resources. The changes may make sense at a global level but don't take into account how we have always done things in Pandora and I would have assumed we would have heard more about the future strategy of our Segment from our Global leaders.

    "ManagerMailBody0": "<br>Dear {{tlInputTeamName_R1}},<br><br>This morning one of our sensors was triggered indicating a problem on one of our roadways. I immediately sent my team to analyze the situation and they've gotten back to me with the news that this leak comes from one of our septriole tanks. While there is no toxicity risk to this, we're reporting a significant leak that has been going on for a while, undetected by our sensors. As a result, we're seeing cross-contamination as septriole has infiltrated some of our other tanks. This is a major issue that needs to be sorted out immediately and our safety and production teams are investigating. We need to clean this up, replace the tanks, and replace the products that have leaked and been cross-contaminated. While it might be quicker to deal with this by shutting down the plant, I'd like to avoid it as much as possible. As you already know, septriole is a new and innovative chemical that's in high demand in the market. Since our plant is the only one to produce this in Pandora, we are already being stretched in fulfilling our current orders and any delays will make it impossible for us to fall within our customers' deadlines. I'll get back to you shortly to give you an estimate of how long this should take so let's see what we can do then.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Helen<br><br>Helen Abatzidi<br>Production Plant Manager, Ernest & Alfred, Pandora Region",
    "ManagerMailBody1": "Dear {{tlInputTeamName_R1}},<br><br>After further examination from my head engineer and his team, we've learned that the leak has infiltrated the ground and caused damage to some of the plant's water supply piping. Unfortunately, I can tell you that we're looking at a 4-6 week closure to make sure that both the leak and underground damage have been repaired. As we're now dealing with an issue with our internal water supply, I see it as imperative for the safety of our people that we respect this timeline. However, at the same time, we need your guidance on how to approach the issue with our clients in the face of major production delays.<br><br>Thank you for your prompt attention to this,<br><br>Helen Abatzidi<br>Production Plant Manager, Ernest & Alfred, Pandora Region",
    "ManagerMailBody2": "Dear {{tlInputTeamName_R1}},<br><br>People outside the organization have now heard about the leak in one of our production facilities. You should know that someone, probably living near the plant, has posted on Twitter earlier a picture showing that something had gone wrong on one of our roadways. In their post, they wrongly mention that it's from a highly toxic chemical rather than septriole. I don't see any major news outlet having picked up on that tweet yet, so we seem to be in the clear for now. However, I am worried that this situation will be bound to escalate quickly one way or another and being associated with a toxic leak is the last thing we need for our image.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Nikos Perez<br>Head of Communication, Ernest & Alfred, Pandora Region",

For reference, you have Last Round's KPIs in brackets. These gauges will only move once you commit to your decisions and move on to the next screen.<br><br> The exception to this is my Capex spend, this moves in real time. Take a look at my Capex as I increase my investment in Sustainability. My decision has increased capital expenditure and will also impact my other KPIs. You can change decisions as many times as you want before committing.<br><br>The part of the screen below the dashboard is where you can make decisions. On the left-hand side are all the decisions you need to make. If you ever have any doubt about a decision, you can find out more about it by hovering on the information button. On the right-hand side, the graphs show the impact of my decisions on the business - they do not require actions. Let's look at the first decision.<br><br> I can set my growth ambitions for the 3 different segments by forecasting my revenue. You do this by clicking on the plus and minus icons. My graphs are changing as I keep increasing my forecast.<br><br>Look at my &quot;Forecast vs previous year&quot; graph: I probably know what the market growth is, so now it is up to me to live up to these growth ambitions.<br><br>I need to do the same for the other 2 segments, messaging the organisation where my priorities lie and the role each segment plays in my overall strategy. The next step is making sure I deliver on this forecast.<br><br>To support my growth ambitions I can set my capex strategy. Do I give significant empowerment to the GBUs to deliver at business unit level or do I rather take a group approach focussing more on capital discipline.<br><br>Now it is time to prioritise my capex allocation. I can invest in megatrends, meaning I will spend my Capex looking for new solutions in line with the megatrends. This might be needed based on my growth ambitions, but I also know I have some overdue maintenance to do, so I also want to invest in capital replacement. If you look at the dashboard you see the Capex spend increasing and I still have to invest in sustainability, a critical part of my strategy.<br><br>I leave this for now and I am ready to commit - once I've committed, I can't change these decisions, but I will always be able to go back and review them.<br><br>I'm now in the second part of my business where I can launch innovations.<br><br>It looks like I have 3 available innovations. For each of these, I need to take 4 steps before I can launch the project. The &quot;Continue Project&quot; button lets me go to the next step. This will come at a cost, so at each step I need to think carefully whether I want to continue or STOP. I must remember to keep an eye on my dashboard.<br><br>Each time I move to the next step, I get more information which helps me decide whether to continue or stop. Once I've done that for all 3 innovations I am all set and ready to commit.<br><br>This part of the business shows E&A Go to market strategy. For each segment, I need to decide how to price it and how to promote it. I need to consider my growth ambitions from the first page and how to materialize this growth. Are the customers price sensitive, what new value will my innovations bring and for a cost, how much do I push my offering by increasing the sales and marketing spend.<br><br>To the right, I can also broaden my offering for each segment which will increase my operating expenses but also increases my sales potential. And the same is true for the level of customisation I offer to my clients; how tailored do I need to make my offering and at what cost?<br><br> I can also work on other parts of my organisation, based on my strategy. This could mean investing in IT platforms, improving backend of the IT landscape. How well do I equip the customer care part of the business and what's the role a good functioning CRM system plays in this. And finally, how much do I want to invest in digitalization, making sure the business is set-up to serve our customer in a new way.<br><br>The team tab is where I manage my time and my team. On the left are my day to day tasks and this is how I spend my time today. I can reconsider my priorities depending on my strategy; this changes my time allocation. <br><br>On the right is where I manage my team. I have 4 team member with their own history in the company and their own skills. <br><br>For each person, I need to prioritize which of their capabilities I want to develop. The time that I have available for my team depends on how I have allocated my own time. So if I make my team's development my top priority, their capabilities will keep growing. <br><br>This is where you can choose to implement 2 internal projects to supplement your strategy. There are 12 to choose from, and you can implement 2 per round. <br><br>This is the final decision for the first round, before the role play! The second round will be identical to the first one... except you'll be building upon your round 1 strategy. As you start making decisions, keep in mind that this isn't just about maximizing your financial performance, but more about how your decisions support your strategy. Good luck!",

Therefore, while making decisions in this simulated environment, please base them on the information at hand rather than your real-life knowledge of Solvay. Before you start diving into the content, we want to emphasize that you will not be assessed on your performance against metrics, but rather on how you portray your strategy and how you execute it. Finally, the strategy that you will be creating and executing for E&amp;A in Pandora does not need to be aligned with Solvay&rsquo;s real-world strategy - in this situation you have the authority and freedom to create your own!<br /><br /><strong>E&amp;A</strong></p><p>E&amp;A is a science company whose technologies and products bring benefits to many aspects of daily life.

    "MoreGenieDesc2": "<p><strong>Operations</strong><strong><br /></strong>At E&amp;A, you will have to make numerous operational decisions in your role as Managing Director. Key decisions include those on your investment strategy. For example, you must decide where you want to prioritize investments to ensure that E&amp;A is either more focused on sustainability, more aligned to customer trends or more focused on improving operational capabilities.</p><p>As Managing Director, you are also able to make investment decisions on your IT platform and CRM systems, as well as the extent to which you digitalize your sites and focus on customer care. As well as this, each round you will be able to select a number of Strategic Initiatives to strengthen the business&rsquo; capabilities across the region. It is important to note that the Strategic Initiatives selected should be aligned with the overall strategy for the region.</p><p>Whilst making your decisions, you should pay attention to your employees&rsquo; experience of work. There is a feeling within HR that productivity and engagement has dropped across the region, which could have negative consequences on the business if not addressed.<br /><br /><strong>Customer trends</strong></p><p>Ernest &amp; Alfred&rsquo;s businesses have been realigned to offer innovations that help to address customer challenges which are in step with six global business megatrends. As well as addressing customer needs through simply making decisions on E&amp;A&rsquo;s business segments, you will also be able to directly meet some of these global challenges through investing in Innovation Projects and Strategic Initiatives. You should consider targeting trends that align with your overall business strategy.</p><ul><li><strong>Electrification</strong>: Growing electric vehicle and consumer electronic markets have contributed to strong growth in demand for batteries. As such, innovative technology is required for faster charging, enhanced battery pack design, and higher energy density batteries. This provides an opportunity for an E&amp;A, as the business is at the cutting-edge of battery innovation.</li><li><strong>Lightweighting:</strong> The global drive to reduce carbon emissions has brought lightweighting to the forefront, given that a 10% reduction in vehicle weight can result in a 6 &ndash; 8% improvement in fuel economy. E&amp;A&rsquo;s alternatives to metals, such as composites, as well as speciality adhesives and coatings, puts the business in a position to address customer's lightweighting needs.</li><li><strong>Resource Efficiency:</strong> Pollution, growing pressure on biodiversity, and climate change are all fuelling the search for resource-efficient solutions. E&amp;A&rsquo;s technologies and products serve markets where this is a key challenge, helping customers to do more with less through energy savings, savings on raw materials and the circular economy.</li><li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> People want to live longer, healthier lives and feel better, through improved work-life balance and higher quality of life. Patients are more involved in their healthcare and demand for medical treatments is growing. E&amp;A can benefit from this through offering biomaterials and thermoplastics that are used in an array of medical devices.</li><li><strong>IoT/Digitalization: </strong>Digital technologies are transforming how we work and how we consume, with increased connectivity and mobility. Miniaturization and optimization of the performance to size and weight ratio will open the way to new materials, chemicals, and coatings that E&amp;A is able to provide.</li><li><strong>Eco-friendly based solutions:</strong> Consumer behaviors are shifting towards wellness, with a preference for higher-quality food and organic, natural solutions. Through a leading position in bio-based ingredients and sustainable solvents, E&amp;A is able to address this consumer trend.</li></ul><p><br /><strong>Competitive landscape</strong></p><p>Within the chemicals industry in Pandora, E&amp;A faces intense competition from both multinational corporations and emerging-market players. Emerging-market players tend to excel in base chemicals and plastics, whereas incumbent multinational companies are generally strong in specialty chemicals. In recent years, mergers and acquisitions between emerging-market players has increased, making these businesses increasingly competitive. Given the market conditions, to maintain competitiveness across business segments, E&amp;A must remain innovative, reliable, and highly responsive to customer needs.</p><p>Thanks to E&amp;A&rsquo;s strong brand and history of excellence, top talents typically want to work for the business. However, although attracting talent is not much of an issue for E&amp;A, retaining talent has proved more difficult in recent times, with competitors investing comparatively more in their employee experience and talent development programs. Going forwards, preventing E&amp;A&rsquo;s top talents from moving to your direct competitors is a challenge that will need to be dealt with if the business is to remain competitive.</p><br>",

Despite this, you have identified ten potential candidates.<br><br><b>Next step</b>: Select the top five submissions to participate in the first wave of incubation.

Nevertheless, the customer experience was not as smooth as it could have been and some of your production lines experienced disruptions due to the customized experience offered to each customer.<br><br><b>Next step</b>: Invest significant resources in opening a new facility which is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment for material testing, virtual engineering and demonstrative production.
